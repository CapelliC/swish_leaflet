### Install

Assuming you have a plain SWISH installation, that is

```
~/swish
```

and you have cloned this repo in ~/swish_leaflet, for instance

```
$ cd
$ git clone https://github.com/CapelliC/swish_leaflet.git
```

then an installation can be accomplished with

```
$ cd ~/swish_leaflet
$ swipl install.pl
```

To change the swish directory, edit the variable in install.pl

```
    % adjust this path to your SWISH installation directory
    SwishRoot = '~/swish',

```
